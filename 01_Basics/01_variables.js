const accountId = 14452;
let accountEmail = "akash@gmail.com";

// console.log(accountId);
// accountId = 2;// it is not allowed to change the value of const variable


accountEmail = "ak.ak@gmail.com";
accountPassword = "akash";
accountCity = "Pune";

//prefer not to use the "var" variable in js
//because of block scope and funcitonal scope of it

//we can declare the variable without these three const, let and var
//but it is bad practice to do this

//there is another method to print in console
console.table([accountId, accountEmail, accountPassword, accountCity, accountState ]);
